# Learning React

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning React. 

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and has gained widespread popularity due to its simplicity, flexibility, and performance. I am excited to learn this library and see how I can use it to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

In this repository, you will find various projects and exercises that I have completed as a part of my learning journey. I will be starting with the basics of React, such as components, props, state, and events, and gradually move on to more advanced topics such as Redux, React Router, and Hooks.

I will be using various resources, such as online tutorials, documentation, and community forums, to learn React. I am open to feedback and suggestions, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any tips or advice for me.

Thank you for joining me on my journey of learning React!
